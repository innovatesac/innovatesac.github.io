Demonstration Partnerships allow the City to test, evaluate, and/or demonstrate innovative solutions to improve quality of life. Emerging technologies and public-private partnerships can help provide services more efficiently, meet community needs, and reduce resource consumption. The City is interested in improving service delivery and catalyzing a vibrant entrepreneurial sphere for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit.
