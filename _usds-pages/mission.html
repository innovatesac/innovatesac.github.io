          <h3>Transforming critical services</h3>
          We’re dedicated to measurably improving our nation’s most important public-facing services. We help to manage technology projects relying on (1) a user-centered design framework to prioritize user needs; and (2) modern software development practices to enable iterative development and the ability to rapidly respond to change and feedback.

          <h3>Rethinking how the government buys digital services</h3>
          We work to modernize procurement processes and practices for the digital era. Just as they do today, skilled contractors will continue to deliver the majority of the government’s digital services.

          <h3>Expanding the use of common platforms, services, and tools</h3>
          We partner with agencies to identify and implement shared tools and services to address common technical issues and usability challenges across the government.

        <li>
          <h3>Bringing top technical talent into public service</h3>
          In support of these goals, we recruit top technologists for term-limited tours of duty with the Federal government. We hope to encourage a tradition of public service in the technology industry that will support the ongoing improvement of government digital services.
